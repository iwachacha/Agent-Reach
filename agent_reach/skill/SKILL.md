description: Windows-first research integration tooling for Codex. Use when the user needs to inspect research channel capabilities, verify readiness, export Codex integration settings, or run thin read-only collection over web, Exa, GitHub, Hatena Bookmark, Bluesky, Qiita, YouTube, RSS, SearXNG, Crawl4AI, Hacker News, MCP Registry, Reddit, or optional Twitter/X.

# Agent Reach

Use this skill when the task benefits from Agent Reach's Windows/Codex integration surface.

## Positioning

This fork is intentionally narrow. Treat it as:

- a bootstrapper for the local research toolchain
- a machine-readable channel registry
- a readiness and diagnostics layer
- an integration helper for downstream projects
- a thin read-only collection surface

Do not assume this fork owns scheduling, ranking, summarization, or publishing. Those remain responsibilities of the host project.
Do not assume this fork chooses investigation scope. The caller chooses scale, routes, source mix, ranking, summarization, and posting.

## Operating Rules For Codex

- Default to the globally installed `agent-reach` CLI in any downstream repository.
- Do not ask the user to copy `.codex-plugin`, `.mcp.json`, `agent_reach/skill`, or Agent Reach source files into the downstream repository unless they explicitly ask for repo-local plugin artifacts.
- Use `agent-reach collect --json` as the stable handoff. Preserve the returned `CollectionResult` JSON when another system will rank, summarize, dedupe, or publish it.
- Keep lightweight asks lightweight. Do not auto-escalate a narrow request into large-scale research.
- Inspect `agent-reach channels --json` `operation_contracts` before choosing per-channel options such as `page_size`, `max_pages`, `cursor`, `page`, `since`, or `until`.
- Use `agent-reach collect --json --save .agent-reach/evidence.jsonl` when a research run needs provenance across multiple commands.
- Use `agent-reach plan candidates --input .agent-reach/evidence.jsonl --json` for lightweight URL or ID dedupe before selected follow-up reads.
- Keep `agent-reach plan candidates` at the default `--limit 20` unless the caller explicitly wants a broader candidate set.
- Use `agent-reach ledger validate --input .agent-reach/evidence.jsonl --json` when downstream automation needs to prove the evidence ledger is parseable.
- Use `agent-reach ledger append --input RESULT.json --output .agent-reach/evidence.jsonl --json` when a successful conditional collection was captured without `--save`.
- Treat `extras.source_hints`, `extras.media_references`, and web extraction hygiene fields as diagnostics only, not ranking or trust scores.
- Treat `doctor --json` as core-blocking by default: tier 0 failures affect the exit code, while optional setup gaps appear under `summary.advisory_not_ready`.
- Inspect `doctor.summary.probe_attention` when a channel has partial probe coverage or a probe run left operations unprobed.
- Treat `batch` and `scout` as explicit opt-in helpers. They are not the default route for everyday collection.
- For large research tasks, only use bounded fan-out when the caller explicitly opts in; then use `plan candidates` for no-model dedupe and deep-read only selected URLs.
- Treat optional channel failures as partial results unless the user asked for strict completeness.

## Discovery First

Start with the integration surface before reaching for backend-specific commands.

```powershell
agent-reach channels --json
agent-reach doctor --json
agent-reach doctor --json --probe
agent-reach collect --channel github --operation read --input "openai/openai-python" --json
agent-reach collect --channel qiita --operation search --input "python" --limit 4 --page-size 2 --max-pages 2 --body-mode snippet --json
agent-reach export-integration --client codex --format json
```

## Supported channels

- `web`: generic page reading through Jina Reader
- `exa_search`: wide web search through `mcporter`
- `github`: repository and code search through `gh`
- `hatena_bookmark`: URL-centric Hatena Bookmark reactions and related entries
- `bluesky`: public Bluesky post search
- `qiita`: public Qiita article search
- `youtube`: video metadata, subtitle availability, captions, and thumbnail references through `yt-dlp`
- `rss`: RSS and Atom feeds through `feedparser`
- `searxng`: configurable metasearch through a user-provided SearXNG instance
- `crawl4ai`: optional browser-backed page reads and bounded same-origin crawls
- `hacker_news`: Hacker News search, story lists, and discussion reads
- `mcp_registry`: public MCP Registry server discovery and reads
- `reddit`: public Reddit search and discussion reads through `rdt-cli`
- `twitter`: optional Twitter/X search through `twitter-cli`

## Workflow

1. Run `agent-reach channels --json` if the available surfaces are unclear.
2. Run `agent-reach doctor --json` when readiness matters.
3. Inspect `summary.blocking_not_ready` and `summary.advisory_not_ready`; add `--exit-policy all` only when every optional channel must be ready.
4. Use `--probe` only when a lightweight live check is useful.
5. Use `agent-reach collect --json` by default when external code needs normalized results, and add `--save .agent-reach/evidence.jsonl` when provenance matters.
6. Use `agent-reach plan candidates` when a saved ledger needs no-model URL or ID dedupe.
7. Use diagnostic hints only to explain provenance or extraction shape; downstream code owns ranking and selection.
8. Use `AgentReachClient` only when the host Python environment has Agent Reach installed into it directly.
9. Choose channels from the live `channels --json` contract for the user's task; Agent Reach does not own ranking, routing, or source policy.
10. Choose advanced collection controls such as page, cursor, and time-window options from the live `operation_contracts`; Agent Reach does not choose collection scope for you.
11. Treat `scout` as a planning helper and capability snapshot, not the default route for a lightweight ask.
12. Treat large-scale research as explicit opt-in. Keep narrow asks on `collect --json` unless the caller clearly wants a broader run.
13. Use `searxng` only after `searxng-base-url` is configured or `SEARXNG_BASE_URL` is set.
14. Use `crawl4ai` only when the optional extra and browser runtime are available; `crawl` requires an explicit `--query` goal.
15. Use `reddit` through `rdt-cli`; it does not need Reddit OAuth, client credentials, or a User-Agent config.
16. Treat Twitter/X as opt-in and cookie-based; authenticated-but-unprobed `warn` means collect may work, but operation readiness is unverified.
17. In arbitrary downstream repositories, use the globally installed `agent-reach` CLI. Do not require copying Agent Reach repo files into the downstream project unless the user explicitly asks for repo-local plugin artifacts.

## Large-Scale Research Pattern

Use this pattern only when the caller explicitly opts into a broader run. Do not auto-escalate a lightweight ask into this path.

1. Run `agent-reach doctor --json` and inspect `operation_statuses` when readiness matters.
2. Start with 2-4 caller-chosen discovery queries at `--limit 5` to `--limit 10`.
3. When a channel supports pagination or time windows, choose `page_size`, `max_pages`, `cursor`, `page`, `since`, or `until` from the live contract instead of assuming one fixed route.
4. If a saved batch plan exists, run `agent-reach batch --plan PLAN.json --validate-only --json` before the write-producing batch run.
5. Add source-specific searches such as `github`, `qiita`, `bluesky`, `rss`, `hacker_news`, `mcp_registry`, `reddit`, `searxng`, or `twitter` only when they match the task and are ready.
6. Save raw `CollectionResult` envelopes with `--save .agent-reach/evidence.jsonl` when the run needs an evidence trail.
7. Run `agent-reach plan candidates --input .agent-reach/evidence.jsonl --by url --limit 20 --json` before deeper reads.
8. Use `web read` for selected URLs, not every search result.
9. Inspect source hints and web hygiene only as non-authoritative diagnostics.
10. Return partial results with clear channel failures instead of blocking on one optional backend.
